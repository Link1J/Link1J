### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jared Irwin, a Computer Science student at Ryerson University. 
I like to try to reinvent the wheel, sometimes, so that I learn more about how somthing works.

I enjoy coding, and am interested in C++, Graphics, Operating Systems, and Programing Languages.

There is one big thing: I am willing to learn to code/use anything, I just need to have something to test on.


### Languages, Libraries, and Tech âš¡
- C++ (Libraries: Qt5, CLI11)
- Windows, with Win32 APIs, COM APIs, and WinRT APIs
- Graphics API: DirectX11, Vulkan, OpenGL
- Linux (X11, POSIX)
- Python
- Typescript/Javascript

### Iâ€™m currently working on ðŸ–¥
- An app that will let Android applications run on other OSes.
- My own helper library with useful classes and functions for many different projects.

### My Systems
- Editor: Visual Studio Code
- Desktop: Intel Core i5-3750, 16GB of RAM, Windows 10 and Linux
- Laptop: Lenovo T470, Intel Core i5, 16GB of RAM, Windows 10 and Linux

### Reaching Me ðŸ“«
> If you are sending me a message for the first time, inform me on who you are. 
> If thats a Discord username, or an event we talked at, anything works.
> I may not be able to remember you from just your name.
